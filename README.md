# Magazine Layout

This project is a responsive magazine-style webpage inspired by a project from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It features a hero section with a title and subtitle, social media icons, and a detailed article with images and quotes.

## Project Structure

### HTML

The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the page. It is organized into several sections:
- **Hero Section**: Contains a large image, a title, and a subtitle.
- **Author Information**: Includes the author's name and publication date.
- **Social Media Icons**: Links to various social media platforms.
- **Text Sections**: Contains the main content of the article with paragraphs and a blockquote.
- **Text with Images**: Includes a brief history section with a list of milestones and an image gallery.

### CSS

The `styles.css` file is responsible for styling the page. It includes:
- **Typography**: Uses custom fonts from Google Fonts.
- **Layout**: Employs CSS Grid and Flexbox to structure the page and make it responsive.
- **Media Queries**: Adjusts styles for different screen sizes to ensure a mobile-friendly experience.

### Key Features

- **Hero Section**: Prominent title and subtitle with a background image.
- **Social Media Icons**: Interactive icons linking to social media profiles using Font Awesome.
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to various screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries.
- **Custom Typography**: Utilizes Google Fonts for a polished look.

### CSS Variables

The project does not use CSS variables but includes detailed styling for various elements:
- **Hero Section**: Styled with large fonts and centered text.
- **Text Sections**: Justified text with custom first-letter styling.
- **Social Media Icons**: Styled with Font Awesome and grid layout.

### Media Queries

The project includes media queries for different screen sizes:
- **Max-width 720px**: Adjusts the layout of images.
- **Max-width 600px**: Changes the layout for text and images.
- **Max-width 550px**: Reduces font sizes for better readability on small screens.
